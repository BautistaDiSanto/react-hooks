Event Loop

Promises, MutationObservers, queueMicrotask, etc -> Micro-task Queue
DOM Events, Network, setTimeout/setInterval, -> Macro-task Queue

Event Loop Tick
1️⃣ Check if Call Stack is empty.
2️⃣ If Call Stack empty → take the first macro-task from the Macro-task Queue → push to Call Stack.
3️⃣ Execute that macro-task completely.
4️⃣ After the macro-task finishes, process all micro-tasks in the Micro-task Queue (Promises, queueMicrotask…).
5️⃣ Repaint (render) if needed.
6️⃣ Repeat (loop).
